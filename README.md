## Usage and functions
User functions include being able to log in and out, see bank accounts/loan accounts and the balances, transfer money between users and internally, see account history, create new accounts and loan money from the bank. The user can see the maximum amount available to loan from the bank. The user can see the interest rate and what payback amount the customer will receive after specified time periods.

Admin functions include being able see the see the complete lists of admins, users, currencies and account types available in the bank. Admins can also create new users, update the currencies, edit user accounts and edit the bank account types avilable.

Further functions in the program include: Users can choose currency when creating accounts. The transfers between accounts with different currencies are converted according to current exchange rates. The currencies are updated by the admins. Login attempts are limited to three tries and blocks the user until admin gives access. The program saves the data from the program database in local textfiles, which can be read as a database. The changes are written in the database between program runs. The users must login using a unique username. The program looks good esthetically with clean menus, coloring and a designed ascii art logo.
